# RepoGrabberGrapher
This tool is designed to help dynamically visualize statistics from a provided dataset generated by the tool '[RepoGrabber](https://github.com/aiapo/RepoGrabber).'

It takes input of a RGDS (RepoGrabberDataSet) from a RepoGrabber run and automatically imports the dataset into a local SQLite DB.

The RGDS format was designed to hold all relevant refactoring data, while being compressed to reduce space on large datasets and easy to work with.

It then spins up a local web server located at port 8000 where you can interact with the dataset dynamically.

# Running
### Install dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Run
```bash
python main.py --rgds YOUR_RGDS_FILE 
```

Where *YOUR_RGDS_FILE* is the RGDS exported from RepoGrabber for repository and refactoring information.

You also may use HTTP directly, and the tool with temporarly download the dataset while it imports in the file. Only on remote imports after import, the file will be deleted.

### Open
The webpage should open automatically in your default browser, but it is located at localhost:8000 as well.

# Todo
* More statistics
* Additional filters
