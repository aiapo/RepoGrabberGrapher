# RepoGrabberGrapher
This tool is designed to help dynamically visualize statistics from a provided dataset generated by the tool '[RepoGrabber](https://github.com/aiapo/RepoGrabber).'

It takes input of a RGDS (RepoGrabberDataSet) dataset from RepoGrabber run and automatically imports the dataset into a local SQLite DB, then runs queries (that are cached once ran once.)

It then spins up a local web server located at port 8000 where you can interact with the dataset dynamically.

# Running
### Install dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Run
```bash
python main.py --rgds YOUR_RGDS_FILE 
```

Where *YOUR_RGDS_FILE* is the RGDS exported from RepoGrabber for repository and refactoring information.

You also may use HTTP directly, but be aware on large datasets this can be slow/undesired. Planning to locally download the CSV if this is choosen, but it's not implemented.

### Open
The webpage should open automatically in your default browser, but it is located at localhost:8000 as well.

# Todo
* More statistics
* SQL intergration
* Additional filters
* Download CSVs locally if they are from a remote source
* Speedups
